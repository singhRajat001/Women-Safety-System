# 🦾Women Safety System using Arduino Nano, GSM and GPS Location Tracker

Women Safety System: Developed a safety device using Arduino Nano, GPS, and GSM modules to provide real-time location tracking and emergency alerts. The system allows users to send their location to pre-defined contacts in distress situations, enhancing personal security.


# 🚨Working Flow
1. User presses Panic Button →
2. Arduino Nano receives the signal →
3. GPS Module provides current location →
4. GSM Module sends alerts to emergency contacts →
5. Contacts receive the user’s location and distress message.

# Explanation
1. The Arduino Nano microcontroller acts as the system's brain. It coordinates all components, processing inputs, and managing outputs.

2. In an emergency, the user presses a panic button. This button is easy to access and triggers the system immediately.

3. The GPS module continuously tracks the user's location. When the panic button is pressed, it sends the current coordinates to the Arduino Nano.

4. The GSM module sends an SMS to predefined contacts or emergency services. This alert includes the user's location and a distress message.

5. If the user needs to be discreet, the system can send alerts without making any noise or visible signals. This silent mode ensures the user can seek help without drawing attention.

6. The system can provide real-time updates to the contacts by sending the latest location data at regular intervals or upon request.
